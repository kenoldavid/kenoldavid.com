<h2 class="text-secondary text-capitalize">What is this site about?</h2>
<p>This is my personal site and blog.</p>
<p>It's a place for people to go to whenever they want to know more about me and where they can easily find out how to contact me.&nbsp; It's also where I will be able to publish content, such as coding experiments and interesting posts on various topics.&nbsp; I plan to write mostly about web development, but since this is my&nbsp;<em>personal</em>&nbsp;site I might also do reviews, rants, and anything else I find worth talking about.</p>
<p>I'm still building out my site, so check back later, or get in touch with me via social media.</p>
