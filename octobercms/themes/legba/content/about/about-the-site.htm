<h1 class="text-secondary text-capitalize">about the site</h1>
<p>
    This URL has been my online home for many years, manifesting at times as a blog or a portfolio until landing on
    this current single-column blog. Today itâ€™s a bit of an outlet graveyard for my design-and development-related
    ramblings.
</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this site is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Designed and coded on a Mac in California
    </li>
    <li>
        Coded with Atom
    </li>
    <li>
        Built on Jekyll, the open source static site generator
    </li>
    <li>
        Hosted on GitHub Pages
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can find more about my macOS development setup in my config repo on GitHub. The design and code powering this
    site, however, is not available for re-use or purchase.
