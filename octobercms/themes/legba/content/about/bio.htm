<h2 class="text-secondary text-capitalize">Who is Kenol?</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Kenol David, Jr., but my friends and colleauges call me Ken. Nice to meet you!&nbsp; I'm a professional software engineer, business analyst and social entrepreneur from New York City.</p>
<p>I have 12-ish years of experience helping top-tier companies in various industries to support and manage their information technology infrastructure and to define and create their products.&nbsp; Currently, I'm coding jacomelo, a digital platform; and,&nbsp;working on building KEDA Solutions, a full-service business consulting and technology solutions firm.</p>
<p>Outside of work I enjoy leading an&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">active lifestyle and keeping fit</span>&nbsp;by playing soccer and taking long walks.</p>
<h2 class="text-secondary text-capitalize">What is this site about?</h2>
<p>This is my personal site and blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a place for people to go to whenever they want to know more about me and where they can easily find out how to contact me.&nbsp; It's also where I will be able to publish content, such as coding experiments and interesting posts on various topics.&nbsp; I plan to write mostly about web development, but since this is my&nbsp;<em>personal</em>&nbsp;site I might also do reviews, rants, and anything else I find worth talking about.</p>
<p>I'm still building out my site, so check back later, or get in touch with me via social media.</p>
